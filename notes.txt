//From prev version

backend stuff ------------------------------------------------------------------


write function that retrieves the dominant color of an image

front end:
interface for the admin page, make it generic so that you can reuse it for other websites (maybe).
Home/timeline page --------------------------------------------------------------------------




If you accidentally drag your cursor over one of the events, it fucks up the entire timeline animation

take care of the setSCrollPositionTOYearX. Right now it's moving without taking into account the 
current position of the moved elements. Can cause offset in a really big screen. Change it so that it
really moves the elements to the actual postiion OR move it to the translateX position where the user begins grabbing. <<< If there is a throttling, this won't be necessary; user won't be able to scroll very far anyway.

Work on admin page's ui and all the internal data.

Make a see all button to let the user see all projects in filter page.
Add see all component, reuse it in the admin page.

Use the new production sql, with this new one added, you'll be able to test your pagination as well.


Make a reusable function for expanding the show all project


these and then deploy, after deploy, the ecommerce website with django: 

get a new screenshot of tripleAGlove with proper ratio
turn throttle thing into a class
reimplement handleEdgeOffset(undefined, true);

Right corner is still being offseted to the top!?

To prod by the end of the  month.
